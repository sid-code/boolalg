## boolalg

`boolalg` is a boolean algebra system written in Nim. It can simplify
boolean algebra expressions in any number of variables to their
minimal sum of products form. It comes with a parser to parse boolean
algebra expressions (see `index.html` for instructions).

It uses an ad-hoc algorithm that runs in polynomial time. It works
well on small expressions with many variables, unlike Karnaugh
maps. However, it cannot simplify arbitrary expressions.

## Building

### Demo

You can build (and run) the demo by running

```
$ nim c boolalg
```

and run it with

```
$ ./boolalg "(-a)b + ac + bc"
```

and it will show you the expression's simplest form.

### Web application

The library can also be compiled to Nim's JavaScript backend. This is done with
the command

```
$ nim js -o:web/app.js app.nim
```

To view the application, open `web/index.html`.

This application is hosted [here][1].
